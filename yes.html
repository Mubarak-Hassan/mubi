    In the quiet whispers of the night,
Your love is my guiding light,
With every heartbeat, I feel you near,
In your embrace, I have no fear.

Your eyes, like stars, they shine so bright,
Illuminating my darkest night,
Your smile, a melody so sweet,
In your presence, my heart skips a beat.

With you, my world is filled with grace,
Every moment, a warm embrace,
Hand in hand, we walk this path,
Together, forever, weâ€™ll make it last.

Your love, a treasure, pure and true,
In every breath, I think of you,
My heart, my soul, they belong to you,
Forevermore, my love, just us two
